# hello_world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub flow.

My name's Alyssa. I'm a UX designer and researcher working in the finance industry. 
I'm pursuing this masters degree in Data Science because I recently started working on AI product design projects.
I want to apply what I learn here to my current projects and projects in the future.
